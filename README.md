# voice-fn - WIP

A Clojure framework for building real-time voice-enabled AI applications. voice-fn handles the orchestration of speech recognition, audio processing, and AI service integration with the elegance of functional programming.

## Features

- Real-time speech recognition with configurable backends
- Clean functional interface for audio stream processing
- Seamless integration with popular AI models and services
- Built-in support for conversation state management
- Efficient audio processing with core.async channels
- Hot-reloadable pipeline components
- Extensible architecture with composable transforms

## Why voice-fn?

voice-fn brings Clojure's functional elegance to voice AI applications. Rather than wrestling with complex state management and imperative audio processing, voice-fn lets you compose transformations as pure functions. Audio streams become just another kind of data flow, managed with the same tools you already use for functional programming.
